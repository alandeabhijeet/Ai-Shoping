This is a shopping web application built using modern technologies, featuring various functionalities to enhance the shopping experience. It offers a user-friendly interface with the latest arrivals, top-rated products, trending items, and customer favorites.

## Integration with GPT-2 and MongoDB Atlas Search

This project integrates **GPT-2** with **MongoDB Atlas Search** to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system. It retrieves relevant information from MongoDB Atlas Search and generates context-aware responses using the GPT-2 language model. The embeddings for retrieval are generated using the **SentenceTransformer** model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

## Frontend
- **React** for dynamic user interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and modern design

## Backend
- **Node.js** and **Express** for the server-side logic
- **MongoDB Atlas** for database management
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication
- **Razorpay** for payment integration
- **Cloudinary** for image hosting
- **MVC Pattern** for maintaining a clean and scalable architecture
- **Flask** for AI-related endpoints
- **Hugging Face Transformers** for language model integration
- **SentenceTransformer** for embedding generation
